# Configuration file for ebusd MQTT integration with Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io/).

# Use this file with ebusd in MQTT JSON mode to have many seen messages automatically appear on HA. This is achieved by
# using the MQTT Discovery feature of Home Assistant (see https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).
# The commandline options to ebusd should contain e.g.:
# --mqttport=1883 --mqttjson --mqttint=/etc/ebusd/mqtt-hassio.cfg


# This file allows flexible construction of MQTT topics and payloads depending on message and field definitions as well
# as global status topics.
# It is a set of named variables (or constants) with the name on the left of an equal sign and the value on the right,
# where only the value is allowed to contain references to other variables.
# A reference to a variable is escaped by a leading "%" character in front of the variable name consisting of only
# alphabetic characters or the underscore. A double percent character "%%" is replaced by a single "%" in the value.
# Curly braces may be used to separate a variable explicitly from the rest, e.g. as "%{version}" instead of "%version".
# Every variable without an underscore in the name is automatically made available as well with an uppercase name and a
# normalized value composed of only alphanumeric characters or underscore (i.e. suitable for being part of a topic).
# When using "?=" instead of only the equal sign in a variable definition, the variable value is set to empty when one
# of the variables referred to is empty or missing.

# The variable replacements are constructed for each message and/or field (depending on whether the topic is field
# specific or not) in the following order:

# 1. predefined constants from ebusd, i.e.
#   %version the ebusd version number.
#   %prefix the invariable prefix part of the "--mqtttopic" configuration option, defaults to "ebusd/".
#   %prefixn the same as %prefix but without trailing slashes or underscores.

# 2. variables referring to constants only (directly or indirectly).

# 3. circuit and message specific variables:
#   %circuit the circuit name.
#   %name the message name.
#   %priority the message poll priority (or 0).
#   %level the message access level (or empty).
#   %messagecomment the message comment.
#   %direction the message direction ("r", "w", "u", or "uw").
#   %topic the message update topic built from the mqtttopic configuration option (only if the topic is not field
#     specific) and/or the %topic variable defined here.

# 4. the direction mapped from variables named "direction_map-%direction" with the actual direction in the suffix.
#     Available as "%direction_map".

# 5. the field type mapped from variables named "type_map-%direction-%type" or "type_map-%type" as fallback with the
#     field type and the optional direction in the suffix. The variable including the direction is evaluated first and
#     if it is missing or the result is empty, the variable excluding the direction is used instead.
#     This is also an implicit field type filter as missing or empty mappings are not published at all.
#     Available as "%type_map".

# 6. other field specific variables for each field (only once for each message if the topic is field specific):
#   %index the numeric field index (excluding ignored fields).
#   %field the field name and key for JSON objects (equals the field index if no name is defined or the names are not
#     unique in the message).
#   %fieldname the field name (and nothing else like in %field, might be empty though!)
#   %type the field type (one of "number", "list", "string", "date", "time", or "datetime").
#   %basetype the base data type ID (e.g. "UCH").
#   %comment the field comment (if any).
#   %unit the field unit (if any).
#   %min and %max the minimum/maximum possible value for number fields.
#   %topic the field (or message) update topic built from the mqtttopic configuration option and/or the %topic variable
#     defined here.

# 7. optional field type switch in "%type_switch" using the value of the variable named "type_switch-by" and matching it
#     against the value lines of the variable named "type_switch-%type" with the field type in the suffix.
#     The value of such a variable needs to be a constant list of string pairs with one pair per line. Each pair is
#     separated by "=" and the left part is the value set to the "type_switch" variable when the wildcard pattern in the
#     right part matches the value of the "type_switch-by" value. The list is traversed from top to bottom with the
#     first match stopping the evaluation. Optionally, "type_switch-names" can be used to define a list of variable
#     names to be set in addition to the "type_switch" variable, in which case a list of variable names (comma
#     separated) is expected as "type_switch-names" value and the appropriate values to set on the left side of each
#     match list entry.
#     Available as "%type_switch" and optionally by the set of fields as defined in "%type_switch-names".

# 8. optional field type part mapping in "%type_part" for each field type in variables named "type_part-%type" with the
#     field type in the suffix (or the value of the "type_part-by" variable).

# 9. if the %fields_payload variable is used, then it is set to the concatenation of all fields of the message:
#   %field_payload is expected to build a single field payload.
#   %field-separator is the separator placed between consecutive field payloads.
#   %fields_payload is set to the concatenation of all fields of the message, separated by %field-separator.

# 10. %definition-topic, %definition-payload, and %definition-retain to build the message definition topic and payload
#     and determine the retain value.


# Before constructing the variable replacements, the messages and fields can optionally be filtered in order to use
# certain message definitions only. All of these criteria are applied, so they are basically combined by "AND".
# Filters with a "partial match" mention in the documentation allow using a limited glob/regex inspired case insensitive
# matching with the following options:
# - "|" allows defining alternatives, e.g. "a|b" matches "but" as well as "all".
# - "^" matches the beginning of the input, e.g. "^al" matches "al" but not "hal".
# - "$" matches the end of the input, e.g. "al$" matches "hal" but not "all".
# - "*" matches a single arbitrary length wildcard part in the middle, e.g. "^a*l$" matches "all" but not "always".

# include only messages having data sent at least once (only checked for passive or read messages, not for active write)
# when set to 1. If set to >1, then all messages passing the other filter criteria (including active read messages) will
# automatically be set to have a poll priority of at most this value, so these are automatically being polled.
