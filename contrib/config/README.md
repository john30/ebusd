## former ebusd.eu config webservice

This is the code of the former webservice at https://cfg.ebusd.eu/ that allowed ebusd to download the needed CSV configuration
files instead of having to install the ebusd-configuration package.

Meanwhile the service was moved to using github pages at `https://ebus.github.io/`.

The code here is kept for those who want to serve the old style configuration on their own.
